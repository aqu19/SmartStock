SmartStock: AI Stock Analyzer with News Sentiment & Risk Prediction is an educational stock market analysis application built for users who are new to the stock market and want to understand how stocks work without investing real money.

Unlike traditional stock market apps that require multiple validations, trading permissions, and complex KYC steps, SmartStock focuses only on stock analysis and learning, while keeping the system secure with strong verification and validation.

The app provides a clean and beautiful user interface where users can explore and analyze both Indian and global stock markets. It includes interactive stock graphs, AI-based news sentiment analysis, risk prediction, and intelligent Buy/Hold/Sell recommendations for educational purposes.

SmartStock is developed using Java and Kotlin for the Android frontend, and a backend system powered by MySQL for storing user data, watchlists, and analysis history.
